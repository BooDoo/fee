# Eliza

Wanted to create a very minimal framework for node.js custom to my thoughts and preferences on code/file structure for web app projects. I've been manually organizing and setting up all my apps at the beginning of a project and am tired of all the time I waste on setup.

## Usage

```
Usage: eliza [options] [command]

Commands:

  new <name> [path]      Create a new application <name>
  cmpt <cmpt> [path]     Generate component <cmpt>, optionally at <path>/components/<component>

Options:

  -h, --help     output usage information
  -V, --version  output the version number
```
